# Multivariate Regression - Fixed and Random Effects Model using Panel Data on R



## Project Objective
Examining the relationship between different categories of trade and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions in both developing countries. The goal is to analyze if total trade, commodity trade and services trade have a similar or different impact on the environment. 

## Outline
Investigating the impacts of each type of trade on the environment in developing countries using a panel data on 147 developing countries from 1960 to 2020 (World Bank). 

## Materials and Methods
Data: A panel data has been used for major macroeconomic indicators (trade, GDP, FDI, Capital, labor force participation rate) and carbon dioxide emissions from the World Development Indicators database available online. 
Model: Three econometric models have been built to compute the total, commodity and service trade. 
Estimation Technique: Fixed and Random Effects method. 
Variables: Carbondioxide emissions (air quality indicator) as a dependent variable while trade, GDP, FDI, capital and labor force are all independent variables. 

## Results
(1) Overall trade increases CO2 emissions.
(2) Commodity trade contributes to higher levels of CO2 emissions than service trade in both developing and developed countries. 
Fixed Effect model have been considered based on the Hausman test. 
It can be inferred that commodities release a higher share of carbon dioxide emissions in contrast to trade in services. Commodity trade involves tangible goods such as manufacturing, agriculture, mines and minerals, stones and precious elements, etc., which emit several harmful gasses as byproducts during their production processes. On the other hand, service trade is trade in services such as human resources and skills in information technology, engineering, etc., showing no statistically significant effect on the environment.
